<p>The Roim is an advanced image viewer of biomedical images of different modalities.
It is designed to be vendor and modality neutral. 
The main goal of the project is to provide as simple as powerful instrument to process nuclear medicine (hereinafter NM) images.  
Nuclear medicine differs from other modalities it is capable of visualizing a function of organs and tissues.
NM images, when appropriate radio-pharmacy, equipment and process are employed can reveal the process of interest.
Hence, images are 3 or 4 dimensional where third dimension of any 3D image can be either temporal or spatial characterisation of the process.
Flat (2D) images are usually provide information on one or another metabolic process.
Most commonly NM images have rather low resolution, number of pixel being compared to say CT or DXR is relatively.
Despite, having pixel values untouched is of highest importance (it gives a possibility to extract characteristics of recorded process)
it should not affect visual representation of the images thus smoothing and colour representation of greyscale images comes to the scene. 
There are standardized guidelines on how to record and process NM images (http://www.eanm.org/publications/guidelines/index.php?navId=37). 
These guidelines work fine for most of the cases but it could fall (be unable to handle data or show meaningless results).                 
In such cases this application would be most helpful.<br>
This development was inspired by success of ImageJ (http://imagej.net/) image processing program.
          
The latest release supports images in DICOM format with raw or uncompressed JPEG data only. <br>
The program does not make any difference of image modality as long as photometric interpretation is MONOCHROME or MONOCHROME2 
and pixel data are 8-16 bits.
STATIC/DYNAMIC/WHOLE BODY/TOMO/TOMO RECON.       

The application has tabbed design. There are three tabs: image viewer, curve viewer and multi-image viewer. 
Here image viewer tab is central element it is responsible for displaying image, applying LUT, controlling W\L              
The processing unit is built around ROI model - elliptic, rectangular and free form ROI are implemented.  

Out of ROI it is possible to visualize densities, areas, min/max/avg pixel values. Curves can be built for dynamic images.
Curve one can   is possible to dispaly curvers and perform simple arithmetic manipulation on them.

The program is written in Java (tm) it is tested to run on both Windows and Linux.</p>
