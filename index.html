<p>Roim (ROI-master) is a biomedical image viewer capable of processing nuclear medicine images. 
It is designed to be vendor and modality neutral. 
Moreover, Roim is a Java (tm) class library developed to simplify building biomedical image processing application.   
It is well known images of Nuclear Medicine (NM) differ from images of other modalities. 
In NM images pixel value represents a number of events (scintillations at a particular spatial location) accumulated through given time interval.<br>
Usually, NM images have rather low resolution 1024x1024 pixels or less while physical pixel size rarely exceeds few to few millimetres.
Quite often images suffer from poor  <abbr title="Signal to Noise Ratio">SNR</abbr>. 
NM images are typically 3 dimensional where third dimension is either time or space i.e. present process or volume. However, 2D and 4D
images are also exist.
Taking all aforementioned into account it is obvious NM images hardly can be processed by means of common image visualization tools.
Dedicated tool shall employ specific image processing to enhance visual perception, offer great flexibility in tuning: colourization, filtering, smoothing, tresholding, etc.  
Otoh, all the calculations have to be done using original pixel values (perhaps on subpixel level).
There is a standardized framework of <a href="http://www.eanm.org/publications/guidelines/index.php?navId=37">guidelines</a> how to record and process NM images. 
Algorithms described in these guidelines work fine for the most of the cases but rarely it could fall being unable to handle data or bring meaningless results. 
Discussing possible causes is clearly out of the scope but it shall be mentioned in many cases the study still can be processed.                     
Such a cases when the application might be helpful the most.
</p><p>
This development was inspired by <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a> image viewer.
The program implements several pixel interpolation algorithms including bicubic and is capable of reading standard <abbr title="LookUp Table">LUT</abbr> palettes in 768 bit NIH format 
and there is a number of built in <span class="t">LUTs</span>.  
The latest release supports images in DICOM format with raw or uncompressed <span class="t">JPEG</span> data only. <br>
The program does not make any difference of image modality as long as photometric interpretation is <span class="t">MONOCHROME</span> or <span class="t">MONOCHROME2</span> 
and pixel data are 8-16 bits.
Supported image types are <span class="t">STATIC/DYNAMIC/WHOLE BODY/TOMO/TOMO RECON</span>.       
<br>Reconstructed tomographic images displayed using <abbr title="Maximum Intensity Projections">MIP</abbr> algorithm.
The application has tabbed design. There are three tabs: image viewer, curve viewer and multi-image viewer. 
Here image viewer tab is central element it is responsible for displaying image, applying LUT, controlling W\L              
The processing unit is built around ROI model - elliptic, rectangular and free form ROI are implemented.  

It is possible to extract some statistics out of ROIs: integral density (sum of pixel values), area (in pixels and millimetres), min/max/avg values.
For a multiframe image (<span class="t">DYNAMIC</span>) ROI will be propagated to all frames thus giving a possibility to extract all aforementioned values of all frames and build a curve.
It is possible to choice what statistics shall be used to make curve: integral density, maximal or minimal value... 
<span class="t">ROI calculator</span> offers base algebraic operations on ROIs and results are also can be visualized as curve.
 
<br>Curves are displayed on separate page where scale/zoom/pan can be applied and it is possible to store entire page into image file.
Also, data mining functionality provided so one can set crosshair markers and move it to extract Y-values.
Markers can automatically be positioned to extremum of a curve.
Curves can be extrapolated using linear and exponential fit built using least squares algorithm.
Finally, curves can be exported to text file CSV - for analysis by means of an external tool. 

<br>The last tab displays a matrix of frames (temporal or transversal slices for tomographic mages).      
<br>The program is written in Java (tm) and run on both Windows and Linux.
