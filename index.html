<p>Roim (ROI-master) is an advanced biomedical image viewer.
It is designed to be vendor and modality neutral. 
The main goal of the project is to provide simple but powerful instrument to process nuclear medicine (hereinafter NM) images.  
Nuclear medicine differs from other modalities it is capable of visualizing function of organs and tissues.
Most of NM images are 3 or 4 dimensional where third dimension of any 3D image can be either temporal or spatial characterisation of the process.
NM images usually have rather low resolution so 1024x1024 pixels or even less.
Hovewer, having pixel values untouched is of highest importance (it gives a possibility to extract characteristics of recorded process)
it should not affect visual representation of the images thus smoothing and colourization of greyscale images comes to the scene. 
The program implements several pixel interpolation algorithms including bicubic and is capable of reading standard LUT palettes in 768 bit NIH format (there is a number of buit in LUTs).  
There is a standardized framework of <a href="http://www.eanm.org/publications/guidelines/index.php?navId=37">guidelines</a> how to record and process NM images. 
Algorithms described in these guidelines work fine for the most of the cases but rarely it could fall being unable to handle data or bring meaningless results. 
Discussing possible causes is clearly out of the scope but it shall be mentioned in many cases the study still can be processed.                     
Such a cases when the application might be helpful the most.<br>
This development was inspired by success of  <a href="http://imagej.net/">ImageJ</a> image processing program.
          
The latest release supports images in DICOM format with raw or uncompressed JPEG data only. <br>
The program does not make any difference of image modality as long as photometric interpretation is MONOCHROME or MONOCHROME2 
and pixel data are 8-16 bits.
Supported image types are <span>STATIC/DYNAMIC/WHOLE BODY/TOMO/TOMO RECON</span>.       
To display reconstructed images MIP algorithm is employed.
The application has tabbed design. There are three tabs: image viewer, curve viewer and multi-image viewer. 
Here image viewer tab is central element it is responsible for displaying image, applying LUT, controlling W\L              
The processing unit is built around ROI model - elliptic, rectangular and free form ROI are implemented.  

It is possible to extract some statistical values out of ROIs: integral density, area, min/max/avg pixel values and perform simple arithmetic manipulation on them.
For dynamic images (aka <b>multiframe</b>) it is possible to build curves of aforementioned values. You are free to select frame to draw ROI on, it will be populated to all frames.
<br>Reconstructed tomographic images displayed using MIP (Maximum Intensity Projections). 

<br>Curves are displayed on separate page where scale/zoom/pan are available an it is possible to store it as an image.
Also, data mining functionality provided so one can set crosshair markers and move it to observe Y-values.
Markers can automatically get moved to curve min/max values.
Using two markers it is possible to interpolate acquired curve with exponential one.
Finally, curves can be exported to text file CSV - for analysis by means of an external tool. 

<br>The last tab displays a matrix of frames (temporal or transversal slices for tomographic mages).      
<br>The program is written in Java (tm) and run on both Windows and Linux.</p>
