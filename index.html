            </a>Welcome to ROI-master GitHub Pages.
        </h3>

<p>The Roim (ROI-master) is a java class library aimed to speed up creation of biomedical image processing applications. 
It is designed to be vendor neutral and support most used modalities. 
This development was inspired by <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a> image viewer, it's usage to process NM images.  
It is well known images of Nuclear Medicine (NM) differ from images of other modalities. 
In NM images pixel value represents a number of events (scintillations at a particular spatial location) accumulated through given time interval.<br>
Usually, NM images have rather low resolution 1024x1024 pixels or less while physical pixel size rarely exceeds few to few millimetres.
Quite often images suffer from poor  <abbr title="Signal to Noise Ratio">SNR</abbr>. 
NM images are typically 3 dimensional where third dimension is either time or space i.e. present process or volume. However, 2D and 4D
images are also exist.
Taking all aforementioned into account it is obvious NM images hardly can be processed by means of common image visualization tools.
Dedicated tool shall employ specific image processing to enhance visual perception, offer great flexibility in tuning: colourization, filtering, smoothing, tresholding, etc.  
Otoh, all the calculations have to be done using original pixel values (perhaps on subpixel level).
There is a standardized framework of <a href="http://www.eanm.org/publications/guidelines/index.php?navId=37">guidelines</a> how to record and process NM images. 
Algorithms described in these guidelines work fine for the most of the cases but rarely it could fall being unable to handle data or bring meaningless results. 
Discussing possible causes is clearly out of the scope but it shall be mentioned in many cases the study still can be processed.          
The library is designed around MVC pattartn where the core element is
<br>The<span class="t">ImageView class</span> - it is a lightweight control capable of displaying medical images. 
Also there is a set of <span class="t">Controllers</span> associated to different kinds of images. 
And, <span class="t">MultiframeImage</span> class - encapsulating actual image, despite of image modality, storage, etc.
There are several classes providing core image processing functionalities. 
The program implements several pixel interpolation algorithms including bicubic and is capable of reading standard <abbr title="LookUp Table">LUT</abbr> palettes in 768 bit NIH format 
and there is a number of built in <span class="t">LUTs</span>.  
The latest release supports images in DICOM format with raw or uncompressed <span class="t">JPEG</span> data only. <br>
The program does not make any difference of image modality as long as photometric interpretation is <span class="t">MONOCHROME</span> or <span class="t">MONOCHROME2</span> 
and pixel data are 8-16 bits.
Following imaging modalities are supported <abbr title="Computed Radiology">CR</abbr>/<abbr title="Computer Tomography">CT</abbr>/<abbr title="Nuclear Medicine">NM</abbr>
<br>Reconstructed tomographic images displayed using <abbr title="Maximum Intensity Projections">MIP</abbr> algorithm.
The application has tabbed design. There are three tabs: image viewer, curve viewer and multi-image viewer. 
The processing model is built around <abbr title="Region of Interest">ROI</abbr> concept. ROIs of following kinds are implemented:  
<ul><li>elliptic, <li>rectangular, <li>free form. </ul>  
It is possible to extract statistics: integral density (sum of pixel values), area (in pixels and millimetres), min/max/avg values.
ROI set on a multiframe images(<span class="t">DYNAMIC</span>) will automatically be propagated to all its frames 
thus giving a possibility to extract all aforementioned statistics out of entire image and build curves.
There are several tools and associated widgets:
<br><span class="t">W/L control</span> - a standard element to control parameters of visual window (width and level). 
<br><span class="t">ROI editor</span> - it lets changing ROI's name, colour and include\exclude them from charting. 
<br><span class="t">ROI calculator</span> - offers base algebraic operations on ROIs and results are also can be sent to charts. 
<br><span class="t">Chart view</span> - based on <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> it offers a number of ways of
presenting acquired data. It naturally supports scaling/zooming/pan and other operations applied to the set of curves.
Using markers it is possible to extract, compare and extrapolate experimental data using linear and exponential fit.
Markers can automatically be positioned to curve minimum and maximum (local and global).
Finally, it is possible to save curves to CSV - file, for the sake of analysis by means of an external tool. 

In order to present capabilities of this class library the small application is included. It has tabbed design. 
<br>The first page is designed to display source image, adjust image size, position, LUT, W/L to better visual perception and let the user set ROI correctly.
ImageView has there the central role. 
<br>The second tab displays is ChartView 
<br>The last tab displays a matrix of frames (temporal or transversal slices for tomographic mages). It is just another instance of ImageView class.
<br>The program is written in Java (tm) and tested to run on Windows and Linux .
